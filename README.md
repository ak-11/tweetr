Tweeter Project
============================

A simple single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5 and plain ol' CSS3 to help web bootcamp students get comfortable with their front-end chops with those technologies.

## Learning Objectives

This project is starter (incomplete) code for students to fork and clone.
The server is built with Node and Express and allows users to request and submit tweets via a JSON end-point. The server/express code should not require any change from the student.
Students must work with and implement the HTML, CSS and client-side JS to bring this project to life.
#### Ajax
  - Can use "ajax" to make asynchronous requests
  - Can use $.ajax to make asynchronous HTTP requests
#### MongoDB
  - Can create a database via the mongo shell
  - Can start the mongo shell with an immediate connection to a database
  - Can create and insert a document
  - Can query for certain documents (find)
  - Can insert multiple documents simultaneously
  - Can start the mongo shell with an immediate connection to a database
  - Can use the "mongo shell" to perform common database operations
  - Can start the mongo shell with no database connection
  - Can perform CRUD operations with mongodb using the mongodb js library

## Functional Requirements
- Single page app architecture.
- Use ajax to communicate w/ Tweeter backend server
- Tweets should be persisted to MongoDB and survive server restart

## Stack Requirements

1. ES6 (Simple, client side JS)
2. jQuery (Ajax)
3. CSS3 (rounded corners, transitions, etc.)
4. Semantic HTML5 tags (section, article, etc)
5. Git for version control
6. MongoDB for persistance
